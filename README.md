Detect smear present on the camera lens through various image processing algorithms
We need to detect smear present on the camera lens through various image
processing algorithms
● The smear appears mostly in all images present in the dataset and its
location is constant throughout
● The remaining additional background appears to be the presence of noise
● The algorithms aim to process and filter out the noise present in the images
● The resulted image is noise free and the smear appears with its contour if it
exists in the dataset
● Anaconda for Python 3.6 and OpenCV 3.1.0 is used to implement the
algorithm
